                      spire plugin uses credentials fetched from the Workload API to call an upstream
                      SPIRE server in the same trust domain, requesting an intermediate signing certificate to use as the server's
                      X.509 signing authority.
                      The SVIDs minted in a nested configuration are valid in the entire trust domain, not only in the scope of the
                      server that originated the SVID.
                      In the case of X509-SVID, this is easily achieved because of the chaining semantics that X.509 has.
                      On the other hand, for JWT-SVID, this capability is accomplished by propagating every JWT-SVID public
                      signing key to the whole topology.
